## Analysis

In this folder one can find two dataset processing pipelines:
- basic-stat-ha.ipynb: notebook that allowed us to take an insight into the distributions and correlations of the selected variables
- cleaning.ipynb: notebook where we load the dataset from the OECD database, extract our variables of interest and format them to our needs


Additionnally the folder contains the correlation matrix of the variables of interest, that sums up the first exploratory data analysis part.
