# Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)
___
  
#### 10% of the final grade

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and
assess the feasibility of your ideas. Please, fill the following sections about your
project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

## Dataset
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it
contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling
visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about
scraping nor data processing.
Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets (Google
dataset search, Kaggle, OpenSwissData, SNAP and FiveThirtyEight)

## Problematic
Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to
develop.

* What am I trying to show with my visualization?
* Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-processing of the data set you chose

* Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

## Related work

* What others have already done with the data?
* Why is your approach original?
* What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other
websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another
context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the
report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
