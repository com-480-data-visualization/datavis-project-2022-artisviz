# Working Time and its socio-economical impacts.


## :pen: Abstract

This repository contains the code for the project of Data Visualisation COM-380 of EPFL by team ArtisViz :fireworks:.

This project aims to document people to help them answer by themselves the following question : how to increase the general well-being of the population while maintaining productivity and keeping a strong economy? 

It offers concise but informative data analyses and visualisations treating the subject on the international level. It delivers a factual understanding of the topic and allows a critical view of politicians' promises in their campaigns.

## :bar_chart: Visualisations

The visualisations are constructed using two tools : [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (Data-Driven Documents) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). D3 is a visualisation kernel based on javascript (javascript library), and Vega Lite a high-level grammar based on D3. You can have access to all the source code of our visualisations directly on the website. You can alse open them in an online editor if you want to fiddle with it and tweak paramters. The visualisations can be saved with SVG or PNG format if you want to use them or identify and interesting behaviour.

## :computer:  Website
