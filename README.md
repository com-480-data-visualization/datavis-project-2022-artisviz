# DataVizCOM480
This repository contains the code for the project of Data Visualisation COM-380 of EPFL by team ArtisViz :fireworks:.

# :bar_chart: Visualisations

The visualisations are constructed using two tools : [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (Data-Driven Documents) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). D3 is a visualisation kernel based on javascript (javascript library), and Vega Lite a high-level grammar based on D3. As mentionned previously, Vega Lite allows to acces the source code, but it also grants acces to an online editor if one wants to tweak paramters. The visualisations can also be saved with SVG or PNG format. For each visualisation, a quick "how to navigate" is presented to give all the power to the reader.

# :computer:  Website
The website compiling our data story and the visualisations is accessible [here](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/datavis-project-2022-artisviz/).
