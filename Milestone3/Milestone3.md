## Milestone 3 (Thursday 28th May, 5pm)
80% of the final grade

### Requirements 
For the final milestone, you need to create a cool, interactive, and sufficiently complex D3.js (and other) data viz on the dataset you chose. Tell a data story and explain it to the targeted audience. Create a process book that details how you got there, from the original idea to the final product. 

You need to deliver the following things:
1. Github repository with a README
    * Host the code and data on Github (if data is too big, link to a cloud storage) with your process book as a PDF file
    * Add a README file that explains the technical setup and intended usage
    * Code should be clean, manageable, and using the latest practices
  
2. Screencast
   * Demonstrate what you can do with your viz in a fun, engaging and impactful manner
   * Talk about your main contributions rather than on technical details 
   * 2 min video (not more)
3. Process book (max 8 pages) 
   * Describe the path you took to obtain the final result 
   * Explain challenges that you faced and design decisions that you took
   * Reuse the sketches/plans that you made for the first milestone, expanding them and explaining the changes
   * Care about the visual/design of this report 
   * Peer assessment: include a breakdown of the parts of the project completed by each team member.

### Grading
The grading is the following:
* Visualization (35%)
* Technical Implementation (15%)
* Screencast (25%)
* Process book (25%)

Grades may vary across the team members, based on the process book and the
peer assessment process. Please provide clear explanations.
