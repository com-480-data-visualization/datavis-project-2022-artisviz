		<h2>Political context</h2>

		Where do people work the most? Can it be related to poverty?
		</p>
		<p>
		Working hours are subject of political debate when it comes to states economic considerations. We attempt to study how this can be verified across selected OECD countries by taking insight of their population's mean working hours as well as of their GDP and poverty rates, as defined by the OECD database [insert link].

		<h2>Where people work the most, do people earn more money?</h2>
		<p>
		Working more should result in a higher wage, right? Let's evaluate people's wealth according to the average hours worked in the country. This is a visualization of the poverty rate as a function of the hours worked.

		<h2>Where people work the less, are they more productive?</h2>

			Some say that working less increases your productivity. Are the countries with less hours worked more productive? Let's visualize GDP per hour worked as a function of the number of hours worked in the country.
